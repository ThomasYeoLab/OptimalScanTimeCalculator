            <p> Amount of fMRI scan time after which researchers find additional scan time unnecessary. E.g. if researcher is interested in maximising cognitive prediction performance, this can be set to 30 minutes.</p>

            <p> Amount of fMRI scan time where researchers feel confident they will have minimum amount of usable data. E.g. if researcher is scanning kids, they might want to set this to a higher amount as more frames will have to be discared due to motion as compared to adults.</p>
